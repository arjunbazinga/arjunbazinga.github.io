  <title>On SaaS and Swimming: Hidden Factors of Success</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Sometimes, insight comes from unexpected places. Today, it came from the pool.<br>
Today while swimming, I had a realization: there’s a lot in common between swimming well and running a successful subscription business.</p>
<section id="the-basics-drag-thrust-and-speed" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-basics-drag-thrust-and-speed">The Basics: Drag, Thrust, and Speed</h2>
<p>When you first start swimming, you think it’s all about moving your hands and legs as powerfully as possible. More force equals more speed, right? This is partly true, but it misses a crucial element: drag.</p>
<p>What matters when swimming is your average velocity over a distance. If you have too much drag, you’ll return to zero velocity after each stroke. But when your drag is low enough, you will accumulate speed with each stroke, reaching a top speed much higher than you would even with your strongest stroke.</p>
<p>In business terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag is your Churn rate, i.e.&nbsp;the opposite of retention rate</li>
<li>Thrust is your marketing effort at any given time</li>
<li>Speed in water is your active user base</li>
</ul>
<p>While marketing is necessary, your active userbase (or speed in the water) is a combination of your past marketing efforts and your retention rate.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual comparison of efficient vs inefficient swimming:</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/miZ23qeMiR0?si=VJiHuxrN0l4kCNelE" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
</section>
<section id="the-hidden-drivers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-hidden-drivers">The Hidden Drivers</h2>
<p>Here’s something counterintuitive: in swimming, your most crucial muscles aren’t the ones you see moving. Your arms and legs create the splash, but it’s your core and hips that truly drive performance. They work silently beneath the surface, maintaining your streamlined form and minimizing drag keeping your body long and horizontal in the water.</p>
<p>The same principle applies in business. It’s easy to fixate on the visible elements - your marketing campaigns, landing pages, and ads. These are your business’s arms and legs, visibly pushing through the market. But your customer support, product reliability, and user experience? They’re your core and hips - less flashy, but absolutely critical.</p>
<p>Just as a swimmer with weak core muscles will struggle regardless of arm strength, a business with poor user experience will flounder despite a massive marketing budget.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-paradox-of-effort" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-paradox-of-effort">The Paradox of Effort</h2>
<p>Even in swimming, there are situations where you need to decide between increasing thrust and reducing drag. A prime example is the use of legs. While leg movement contributes about 15% to overall thrust, it dramatically increases drag and often worsens your form. Counterintuitively, the advice for swimming well, especially when starting out, is to use your legs less – sometimes barely moving them at all.</p>
<p>This paradox has a direct parallel in business. Many companies engage in practices that seem to increase “thrust” but actually create more “drag”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggressive upselling and cross-selling</li>
<li>Intrusive advertising</li>
<li>User interface “dark patterns” that trick users into spending more</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, these tactics might bring in additional revenue (power) in the short term. But in the long run, they increase your drag by driving users away from your product. It’s a classic case of short-term gain leading to long-term pain. For a deeper dive into this concept and how to approach it, I recommend reading the insightful article on <a href="https://zerodha.tech/blog/user-disengagement">user disengagement</a> by Zerodha.</p>
</section>
<section id="reducing-business-drag" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reducing-business-drag">Reducing Business Drag</h2>
<p>In business, reducing drag means focusing on retention. I’ve found this means:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understand why people leave. Talk to unhappy customers.</li>
<li>Identify unmet needs and fix what’s broken.</li>
<li>Do the unglamorous work that’s important to customers.</li>
<li>Treat customers as you’d want to be treated, be respectful of their time and attention.</li>
</ol>
<p>These actions might not feel as impactful as big marketing pushes, or as cool as working on bleeding-edge technology, but they’re crucial for long-term success. They’re the equivalent of perfecting your swimming form - less visible, more effective.</p>
</section>
<section id="optimizing-for-success" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimizing-for-success">Optimizing for Success</h2>
<p>Another parallel: You can only optimize one aspect at a time. There’s a limit to what your brain can focus on. In swimming, you might want to improve your arm stroke, leg kick, hip rotation, and breathing simultaneously. In business, you’re juggling product improvements, customer support, marketing, and operations.</p>
<p>Trying to fix everything at once leads to slow progress and ingrained bad habits. Instead:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose one <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951">specific area</a> for improvement</li>
<li>Practice with perfect form and intense focus</li>
<li>Repeat until the action becomes automatic</li>
</ol>
<p>This applies to both swimming and running a company, but with a key difference. In swimming, “automatic” means the movement becomes part of your neural structure, performed subconsciously. In business, it’s about setting up the right culture, people, processes, and incentives so things run smoothly without constant oversight.</p>
<p>This approach might seem slow, but it leads to sustainable, compounding improvements. You’re not just doing things right when actively focusing - you’re making high standards your default state.</p>
<p>You’ll notice Olympic swimmers cross the pool in minimal strokes - that’s mastery in action. In business, it might look like efficient processes, strong culture, the right people, and well-set incentives.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-long-game" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-long-game">The Long Game</h2>
<p>In swimming and in business, what looks like effort isn’t always what moves you forward.<br>
Sometimes, the key to speed is doing less. Moving your legs less in the water. Pushing your customers less.<br>
Focus on reducing drag. In SaaS, that means understanding your users. Solving their problems. Respecting their time.<br>
It’s not as visible as marketing. But it’s what separates great products from the rest.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Reflecting on these parallels between swimming and business, I’m reminded of Miyamoto Musashi’s quote, which could be a fitting end to this post.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If you know the way broadly you will see it in everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I’m also reminded of Abraham Maslow.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because while there’s wisdom in drawing parallels, there’s also wisdom in knowing when to put down the metaphorical hammer.</p>
<p>Here are three important ways where the analogy breaks down which you should keep in mind.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Environmental Consistency: Water provides a consistent environment for swimmers. In contrast, the business landscape is constantly changing, more akin to swimming in a dynamic, unpredictable ocean. your drag (churn) could suddenly rapidly increase because of competitors, regulation, effectiveness of your channels etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback Loops: In swimming, improvements in technique have a relatively linear effect on performance. In business, positive feedback loops (like network effects) can lead to exponential growth, a phenomenon not typically seen in swimming.</p></li>
<li><p>Nature of the End Goal: In swimming, the objective is typically to minimize time over a fixed distance. This is a well-defined, closed-ended goal. In business, particularly for SaaS, the goal is often open-ended growth. There’s no fixed “finish line” - the objective is continuous expansion and improvement, potentially without limit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So take this post with a pinch of chlorine, maybe it’ll help you cut through the drag in your business (or your breaststroke), or maybe it’ll just give you a chuckle the next time you’re at the pool.</p>
<p>Either way, happy swimming - and happy entrepreneur-ing!</p>
<p>PS: If you’re learning to swim, I highly recommend “Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way to Swim Better, Faster, and Easier”.</p>

  <title>The state of reading in 2018 and beyond.</title>
  <dc:creator>Arjun Srivastava</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.arjunsriva.com/posts/state-of-reading/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Audio books are seeing a resurgence, because of companies like Audible.<br>
Text to speech is good, and is getting <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio">better</a> .<br>
Wireless Bluetooth <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">earphones</a> are becoming common place, the increase in convenience and battery life allows people to have them on longer.<br>
Unlike content that you have to watch/read, you can work on other stuff while you listen.<br>
I see a time where we can listen to most of the things we read.<br>
Creates a whole new kind of medium.<br>

  <title>Infant Mortality In India</title>
  <dc:creator>Arjun Srivastava</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.arjunsriva.com/posts/infant-mortality/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I thought about this after reading <a href="https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_8.html">Doing good better</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after I found out about kepler.gl which made this the perfect project to test it out.</p>
<p>I extracted the data I needed for my analysis from a PDF of an annual summary report by the Government of India, available <a href="https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/Pages/RHS2017.aspx">here</a>, as I couldn’t find a comprehensive and user-friendly source.</p>
<p>You can read the analysis <a href="https://arjunsriva.com/infantmortality">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://kepler.gl/#/demo?mapUrl=https://www.arjunsriva.com/posts/infant-mortality/kepler.gl.json">Here</a> is the kepler.gl map I created for this analysis.</p>
<p>It contains the following layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Lives Lost: The number of infants who died in each state. The height of each region is proportional to the number of lives lost, with redder regions having a higher infant mortality rate.</li>
<li>Total Population : The population of each state. The height of each region is proportional to the population, with bluer regions having a higher birth rate.</li>
<li>Total Lives Lost Rural: The same as Total Lives Lost, but only for rural areas in each state.</li>
<li>Total Lives Lost Urban: The same as Total Lives Lost, but only for urban areas in each state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the map loads you can click on the layers on the right to toggle them on and off. You can also click on the layers to see the data for each region.</p>
<p>The json file for the map is available <a href="kepler.gl.json">here</a>.</p>

<p>What if instead of aiming for clarity and conciesness, our goal was to make our sentences as unweildy and hard to understand as possible?</p>
<p>A simple way to do this is to replace easy to understand phrases with harder ones. Wikipedia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190622035102/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_plain_English_words_and_phrases">maintains</a><sup>1</sup> one such list for us. <a href="https://arjunbazinga.github.io/jargonizer">Here is the website</a> I made so you can play with it online as well, it all runs in your browser, no text is sent to a server.</p>
<p>Reading at the output generated from this, I can’t help but feel like I am reading a legal document.</p>

<section id="staying-up-to-date" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="staying-up-to-date">Staying Up-to-Date</h3>
<p>One of the best things about the machine learning field is how much work happens in the open.</p>
<p>Many researchers publish their work on arXiv months or even years before it appears in journals or at conferences. Following key researchers and institutions on Twitter is an excellent way to stay informed about the latest developments as they happen.</p>
<p>Some great accounts to follow: <span class="citation" data-cites="goodfellow_ian">@goodfellow_ian</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="ylecun">@ylecun</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="karpathy">@karpathy</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="gwern">@gwern</span>.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid of reading arXiv papers, they might seem intimidating in the beginning but they get easier over time.</p>

<p>An agent here is a player who pulls arms to play. It has a policy, which is a list of probabilities associated with each arm.</p>
<p>The agent class makes designing agents <strong>fast</strong>. The object is initialised with arms and whether it should play all arms once as part of the initialisation.</p>
<p>Features provided by this class:<br>
Attributes: * expectations[i]: gives the expected reward on playing arm[i] * times_played[i]: gives the number of times the agent has played arm[i] * N = Total number of times agent has played * reward_history : list of rewards earned by the agent * choice_history : list of choices made by the agent</p>
<p>Methods: * gamble(i): Plays for i iterations while updating it’s policy. * play(i): Pulls arm[i] and updates reward_history, N , times_played * select_arm(): returns index of an arm by sampling probability distribution given by the policy</p>

<p>This quiz was created as part of cultural week, right as Game of Thrones season 7 ended.<br>
It is broken into 3 seperate rounds</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>first round, acts as elimination to reduce the number of teams that play.</li>
<li>second round where each team sees one question at a time and can write their answers, and the quiz master checks if they got it right and awards +1 for correct answers. the correct answer is revealed after each question.</li>
<li>third round consists of Connect questions, where for each question a series of hints are given, with the total points awarded for correct points reducing as the number of hints increase.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This post is a bit of a meta post about arjunsriva.com</p>
<p>A lot of my thinking on personal websites has been influenced by other great websites like Gwern’s, please <a href="https://gwern.net/about">read this</a> if you’re interested in it.</p>
<p>My goals for this websites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To share things I learned that I personally found useful</li>
<li>To provide a playground for me to flesh out rough ideas and speculate.</li>
<li>To help me increase the clarity of my thinking by the act of writing something out.</li>
</ul>
<p>on the implementation side my goals are</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easy for me to never lose data
<ul>
<li>most writing is stored as simple text files, version controlled by git</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make it easy to mix code and prose to explain certain concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things that I plan on implementing later as I write more are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic link archiving to prevent link rot</li>
<li>Confidence tags to show how certain I am of different things</li>
<li>Better sections / tagging to differentiate different kinds of posts, eg. reading list and notes</li>
</ul>

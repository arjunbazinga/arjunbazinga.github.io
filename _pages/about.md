Hi! I'm Arjun, 

I currently work at [BookMyShow](https://bookmyshow.com) on Discovery. Previously I built Proof of Stake blockchains at Zebi. I got my bachelors in Computer Science from  IIT Indore.  


I'm interested in Experimentation platforms, Reccomendation Systems, and Market Design.
I love to read, and three books that I reccomend most often are [Dataclysm](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_698.html), [7 Powers](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_1/book_1030.html), and [Model Thinker](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_699.html).  
I also love Biryani and Skateboarding. 
Some of my other interests are:

- Computer Science
  - Machine learning
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Distributed Systems
    - CRDTS
    - Local First Software
  - Program Synthesis
  - Language Design
  - Software Engineering
- Startups
  - SAAS
  - Fundamental Investing
- Finance
  - Market design
  - Options
- Mental Models



If any of these interest you too, I would love to talk to you about it, please use the links in the footer to get in touch.

<!-- PS: My interests tend to be strongly correlated to books I just read or am currently reading.

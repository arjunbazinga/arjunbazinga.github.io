2. second round where each team sees one question at a time and can write their answers, and the quiz master checks if they got it right and awards +1 for correct answers. the correct answer is revealed after each question.
3. third round consists of Connect questions, where for each question a series of hints are given, with the total points awarded for correct points reducing as the number of hints increase.

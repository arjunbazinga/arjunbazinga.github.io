I thought about this after reading [Doing good better](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Altruism/dp/1592409660) (highly recommend). 
 
Soon after I found out about kepler.gl which made this the perfect project to test it out.

I extracted the data I needed for my analysis from a PDF of an annual summary report by the Government of India, available [here](https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/Pages/RHS2017.aspx), as I couldn't find a comprehensive and user-friendly source.


Read the analysis [here](https://arjunsriva.com/infantmortality).

Here is the kepler.gl map I created for this analysis. You can interact with it [here](https://kepler.gl/#/demo?mapUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arjunbazinga/arjunbazinga.github.io/gh-pages/posts/infant-mortality/kepler.gl.json).

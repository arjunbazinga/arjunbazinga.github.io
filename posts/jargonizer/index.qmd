What if instead of aiming for clarity and conciesness, our goal was to make our sentences as unweildy and hard to understand as possible? 

A simple way to do this is to replace easy to understand phrases with harder ones. 
Wikipedia [maintains](https://web.archive.org/web/20190622035102/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_plain_English_words_and_phrases)[^1] one such list for us.
[Here is the website](https://arjunbazinga.github.io/jargonizer) I made so you can play with it online as well, it all runs in your browser, no text is sent to a server.

Reading at the output generated from this, I can't help but feel like I am reading a legal document.

This post is a bit of a meta post about arjunsriva.com

A lot of my thinking on personal websites has been influenced by other great websites like Gwern's, please  [read this](https://gwern.net/about) if you're interested in it.

My goals for this websites are:

* To share things I learned that I personally found useful
* To provide a playground for me to flesh out rough ideas and speculate.
* To help me increase the clarity of my thinking by the act of writing something out.

on the implementation side my goals are

* Make it easy for me to never lose data
  * most writing is stored as simple text files, version controlled by git
* Make it easy to mix code and prose to explain certain concepts

Some things that I plan on implementing later as I write more are:

* Automatic link archiving to prevent link rot
* Confidence tags to show how certain I am of different things
* Better sections / tagging to differentiate different kinds of posts, eg. reading list and notes

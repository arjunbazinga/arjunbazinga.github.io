categories: [ Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Adaptive Systems ]
description: "The paper discusses the development of Transformer2, a framework for self-adaptive Large Language Models (LLMs), introducing a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called Singular Value Fine-tuning (SVF). The paper explores three distinct adaptation strategies within Transformer2 and evaluates its performance on various tasks and datasets."

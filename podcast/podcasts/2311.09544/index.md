title: "Scaling User Modeling for Personalized Advertising at Meta"
categories: [ Personalized Advertising, User Modeling, Deep Learning, Neural Networks ]
description: "The paper explores the challenges faced by Meta in scaling user modeling for personalized advertising, introducing the Scaling User Modeling (SUM) framework. SUM leverages upstream user models to synthesize user embeddings shared across downstream models, addressing constraints on training throughput, serving latency, and memory in large-scale systems."

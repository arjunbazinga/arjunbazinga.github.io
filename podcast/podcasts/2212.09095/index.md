categories: [ Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Transformer Architecture, In-Context Learning, Model Pruning ]
description: "The paper investigates the necessity of all components in massive language models for in-context learning, aiming to determine if the sheer scale of the model is essential for performance. By conducting structured pruning and analyzing task-specific importance scores, the researchers found that a significant portion of the components in large language models might be redundant for in-context learning, suggesting potential efficiency improvements."

title: "Efficient Compression of Large Language Models using LLM-Pruner"
categories: [ Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Model Compression ]
description: "The podcast discusses a paper that introduces LLM-Pruner, a task-agnostic framework for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) through structural pruning. The framework consists of three stages: Discovery, Estimation, and Recovery, enabling efficient compression without sacrificing model performance."

LLM-Pruner utilizes structural pruning and a post-training method called LoRA to compress LLMs without task-specific retraining. The framework demonstrates promising results in maintaining model performance even with pruning up to 20% of parameters.

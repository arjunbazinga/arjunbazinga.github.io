Key takeaways for engineers/specialists include the discovery of a 'hunchback' shape for intrinsic dimensionality across layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a strong correlation between the ID in the final layer and performance on unseen data. The findings indicate that deep networks compress information into low-dimensional manifolds to generalize effectively, involving non-linear transformations for achieving linearly separable representations.

title: "Segment Anything: A Paradigm Shift in Image Segmentation"
categories: ['Computer Vision', 'Deep Learning', 'Machine Learning']
description: "The 'Segment Anything' paper introduces a paradigm shift in image segmentation by leveraging large language models' success in natural language processing. It presents the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that can understand a broad range of prompts to accurately segment any object in an image. The paper addresses the challenge of massive data annotation by introducing a novel 'data engine' that enables SAM to generate high-quality masks for over 1 billion objects."

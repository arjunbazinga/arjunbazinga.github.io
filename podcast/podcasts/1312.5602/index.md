title: "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning"
categories: ['Deep Learning', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence']
description: "The paper discusses the introduction of Deep Q-learning (DQN) in reinforcement learning to handle high-dimensional sensory inputs directly from raw data, specifically in playing Atari 2600 games. The approach utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the action-value function and incorporates experience replay to address challenges of correlated data and non-stationary distributions in reinforcement learning."

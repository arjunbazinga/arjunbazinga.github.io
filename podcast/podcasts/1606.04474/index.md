Engineers and specialists can learn from this paper that training an LSTM-based optimizer can outperform traditional hand-crafted optimization algorithms across various tasks. The use of coordinatewise LSTMs and backpropagation through time for training provides scalability, efficiency, and generalizability. The approach shows promise for automating hyperparameter tuning, developing specialized optimizers, and enhancing the robustness of neural networks.

title: "Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision"
categories: ['Computer Vision', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Multimodal AI']
description: "The paper introduces CLIP, a groundbreaking approach that leverages natural language descriptions to train computer vision models without the need for labeled image data. By teaching systems to understand the relationship between images and text, CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot learning tasks and demonstrates robustness to variations in image data distribution."

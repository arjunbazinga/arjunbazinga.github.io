title: "On the Measure of Intelligence"
categories: ['Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Explainable AI']
description: "The paper challenges conventional approaches to measuring intelligence in machines, arguing for a focus on generalization and adaptability rather than narrow task-specific skills. It introduces a new benchmark called ARC, designed to measure human-like general intelligence and program synthesis through tasks requiring abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities."

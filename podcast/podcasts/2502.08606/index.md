title: "Distillation Scaling Laws"
categories: [ Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing ]
description: "The paper focuses on creating smaller, more efficient language models through knowledge distillation. The research provides a 'distillation scaling law' that helps estimate student model performance based on teacher performance, student size, and distillation data amount."

The key takeaways for engineers/specialists include using the distillation scaling law for resource allocation decisions, understanding the importance of compute and data requirements, and resorting to supervised learning only when a well-designed plan for the teacher model is unavailable to avoid additional costs.

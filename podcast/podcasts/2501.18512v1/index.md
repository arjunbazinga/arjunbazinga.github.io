Streaming DiLoCo introduces three main improvements: streaming synchronization reduces peak bandwidth, overlapping communication with computation hides latency, and quantization compresses data exchanged between workers. The research shows similar performance to Data-Parallel training but with significantly reduced bandwidth, making it a promising approach for distributed LLM training.

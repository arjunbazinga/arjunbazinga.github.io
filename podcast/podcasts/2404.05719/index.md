Ferret-UI is the first UI-centric MLLM capable of executing referring, grounding, and reasoning tasks, making it adept at identifying specific UI elements, understanding relationships, and deducing overall screen function. It breaks down screens into sub-images using the 'any resolution' approach, providing detailed understanding of UI elements and interactions.

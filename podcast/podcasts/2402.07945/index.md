title: "ScreenAgent: A Vision Language Model-driven Computer Control Agent"
categories: [ Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing,  Artificial GUI Interaction ]
description: "The paper discusses a novel approach called ScreenAgent that enables vision language models (VLMs) to control a real computer screen by generating plans, translating them into low-level commands, and adapting based on screen feedback. It introduces the ScreenAgent Dataset for training and evaluating computer control agents in everyday tasks."

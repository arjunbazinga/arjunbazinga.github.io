The paper introduces Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) for urban scene reconstruction, addressing limitations in current methods by using 3D Gaussian Splatting for scene representation. By incorporating surface normal information and leveraging diffusion models, the proposed method, VEGS, outperforms existing approaches in generating visually realistic and accurate renderings for urban environments.

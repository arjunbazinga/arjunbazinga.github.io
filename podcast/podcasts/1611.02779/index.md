Engineers and specialists can benefit from RL2 by understanding how meta-learning can bridge the gap between slow deep reinforcement learning and fast human learning speeds. This approach offers a way to encode prior knowledge in an RNN to make RL algorithms more efficient, adaptable, and scalable to complex real-world scenarios.

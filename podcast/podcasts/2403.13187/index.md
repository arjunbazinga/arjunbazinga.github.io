title: "Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes"
categories: [ Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing ]
description: "The paper delves into the world of model merging, exploring a novel method called 'Evolutionary Model Merge' that uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically discover and combine pre-trained large language models (LLMs). The approach optimizes both the parameter space and data flow space to create more powerful and versatile AI models."

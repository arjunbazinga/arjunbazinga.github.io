NerfBaselines addresses the inconsistent evaluation protocols in comparing novel view synthesis methods by providing a unified interface, ensuring reproducibility through containerization, and standardizing the evaluation protocol. By enabling the sharing of pre-trained checkpoints, it reduces computational costs and environmental impact. However, it relies on methods exposing the same interface and future directions involve exploring advanced evaluation metrics and addressing the computational cost of training.

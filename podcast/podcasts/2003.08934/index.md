categories: ['3D Vision', 'Computer Vision', 'Deep Learning']
description: "The paper 'NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis' introduces a novel approach to view synthesis using a continuous 5D representation of scenes. By utilizing a neural network to create a function mapping 5D coordinates to the scene's properties, NeRF can produce high-fidelity renderings from any viewpoint, outperforming traditional methods."

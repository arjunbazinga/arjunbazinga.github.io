## **Byte-Sized Breakthroughs Podcast**

![](/static/podcast_data/website-coverart.webp){ width=600px }

I love Arxiv, but often find myself with pockets of time when I can't sit down and read. 
This podcast bridges that gap, offering bite-sized explorations of individual papers.

A few things to note:

1. The voices you'll hear are AI-generated, not real people (though names from papers might appear).
2. While we strive for accuracy, these are complex topics. Our current AI systems aren't perfect, so approach with a critical mind.
3. Consider this a starting point. For deeper understanding, always refer to the original paper.
4. The papers featured are ones I'm personally interested in or have been wanting to read. It's a curated selection based on my interests.

This podcast aims to spark curiosity and make cutting-edge research more accessible. It's perfect for those moments when you want to learn but can't dive into a full paper.

Enjoy the exploration of ideas, and let it fuel your interest in further reading!

## The Team

Our hosts bring each paper to life:

- **Alex Askwell**: Our curious and knowledgeable moderator, always ready with the right questions to guide our exploration.
- **Dr. Paige Turner**: Our lead researcher and paper expert, diving deep into the methods and results.
- **Prof. Wyd Spectrum**: Our field expert, providing broader context and critical insights.

Join them as they break down complex research into byte-sized breakthroughs!

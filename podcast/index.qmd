## About

1. The voices you'll hear are AI-generated, not real people (though names from papers might appear).
2. While we strive for accuracy, these are complex topics. Our current AI systems aren't perfect, so approach with a critical mind.
3. Consider this a starting point. For deeper understanding, always refer to the original paper.
4. The papers featured are ones I'm personally interested in or have been wanting to read. It's a curated selection based on my interests.

This podcast aims to spark curiosity and make cutting-edge research more accessible. It's perfect for those moments when you want to learn but can't dive into a full paper.

Enjoy the exploration of ideas, and let it fuel your interest in further reading!

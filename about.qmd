Hi! I'm Arjun, an engineer and researcher. Currently, I'm working at [Woven By Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/), my key focus areas are machine learning and data. I lead many initiatives, from data infrastructure, storage (operational stores, datawarehouse), ETL (pipelines, scheduling) from scratch, to designing adaptive assessments, and developing course recommendation systems as one of the founding engineers at [MS1]().

Before joining Woven, I worked at [BookMyShow](https://bookmyshow.com), where I worked on the development of discovery and personalization systems. It was a fantastic opportunity to learn and grow while helping millions of users find their perfect entertainment experiences. 


# Influences

A lot of my early years was spent growing up on the internet, when I was 11 years old, I found websites like MIT OpenCourseWare and the Linux Documentation Project, I was able to tap into a wealth of knowledge that transformed my life. This makes me believe in open access to knowledge, and open technology create opportunities for people from all walks of life.

I firmly believe that advancements in science and technology hold the key to unlocking human potential and solving the world's most pressing challenges. 

At the same time, I'm a strong proponent of personal freedom and the idea that we should all have the autonomy to chart our own paths in life. 

I draw inspiration from companies like Toyota, with their relentless focus on excellence and respect for people, and Zerodha, with their no-nonsense approach to democratizing access to investing. I'm also a big admirer of Charlie Munger's interdisciplinary thinking and his ability to draw on diverse mental models to make better decisions.

# Interests

I love to read to better understand our world. Some of my favorite books are "[Dataclysm](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_698.html)" by Christian Rudder, "[7 Powers](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_1/book_1030.html)" by Hamilton Helmer, and "[Model Thinker](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_699.html)" by Scott E. Page. 

I also love biryani (who doesn't?) and enjoy skating and swimming.

Books like "[Dataclysm](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_698.html)," and "[Who Gets What--And Why](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_1/book_1000.html)" is one of the reasons I've developed a bit of a fascination with marketplaces and how to design them well. 

I did my undergrad in Computer Science from IIT Indore, which further enhanced my curiosity on things like distributed systems (byzantine distributed consensus algorithms in particular), language design (automatic code generation / performance optimization), and algorithm design (especially algorithms that learn)

Currently, my interests lie in the inference and training of large language models on smaller machines, interpretability, and in-context learning. Although scaling laws are helping us build more capable models, I believe we are still in the early stages of algorithmic progress in deep learning systems.

If any of this resonates with you, please don't hesitate to reach out, I look forward to hearing from you! you can reach me at arjunsriva at gmail.

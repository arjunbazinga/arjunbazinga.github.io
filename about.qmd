An engineer and researcher currently working at [Woven By Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/). My key focus areas are machine learning, data infrastructure, and personalization systems.


# Professional Experience

## Woven By Toyota
At [Woven](https://woven.toyota/en/), I lead multiple projects in data infrastructure, for storage (operational stores, datawarehouse) and processing (ETL pipelines, scheduling, collaborative workspaces). 
I also developed machine learning systems for things like [adaptive assessments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory), course recommendation systems as one of the founding engineers of [MS1](www.ms1.com), a startup(ish) focused on talent management.

## BookMyShow
Previously, at [BookMyShow](https://bookmyshow.com), I worked on the development of real-time data pipelines for discovery and personalization systems, helping millions of users find entertainment experiences.


# Education

I did my undergrad in Computer Science from IIT Indore, which gave me a long-lasting curiosity in areas like:

*  algorithms (that learn from their data)
*  distributed systems (byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms, CRDTs) 
*  language design (automatic performance optimization, program generation)


# Influences and Beliefs
Growing up, I discovered websites like MIT OpenCourseWare and the Linux Documentation Project, which opened up a world of knowledge and opportunity for me. This experience shaped my belief in the power of open access to knowledge and technology to transform lives.

I am a big fan of companies and people that are able to take a long term approach and deliver results.  Like [Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way), with their focus on quality and respect for people, [Zerodha](https://zerodha.tech/blog/scaling-with-common-sense/), with their no-nonsense approach to building a longterm focused business, and [Charlie Munger](https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/)'s interdisciplinary thinking and his ability to draw on diverse mental models to make better decisions.


# Interests and Expertise

I believe we are still in the early stages of algorithmic progress in deep learning systems and while we have been able to make useful models by scaling up, we are yet to discover far more compute and data-efficient algorithms.
My current interests lie in the inference and training of large language models on smaller machines, interpretability, and in-context learning.

I'm also fascinated by marketplaces and mechanism design, influenced by books like "[Dataclysm](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_698.html)" by Christian Rudder and "[Who Gets What--And Why](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_1/book_1000.html)" by Alvin E. Roth I am interested in how we can leverage ML to create better marketplaces. (reputation systems, matching algorithms, spam detection, pricing algorithms, etc.)

# Personal Interests

I love to read books to better understand our world, some books that I reccomend are  "[7 Powers](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_1/book_1030.html)" by Hamilton Helmer and "[Model Thinker](https://www.arjunsriva.com/library/book_0/book_699.html)" by Scott E. Page.

I'm also a big fan of biryani and enjoy skating and swimming.

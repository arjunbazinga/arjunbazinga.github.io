The height of each region is proportional to the population, with bluer regions having a higher birth rate.\nTotal Lives Lost Rural: The same as Total Lives Lost, but only for rural areas in each state.\nTotal Lives Lost Urban: The same as Total Lives Lost, but only for urban areas in each state.\n\nOnce the map loads you can click on the layers on the right to toggle them on and off.

    "text": "The Basics: Drag, Thrust, and Speed\nWhen you first start swimming, you think it’s all about moving your hands and legs as powerfully as possible. More force equals more speed, right? This is partly true, but it misses a crucial element: drag.\nWhat matters when swimming is your average velocity over a distance. If you have too much drag, you’ll return to zero velocity after each stroke. But when your drag is low enough, you will accumulate speed with each stroke, reaching a top speed much higher than you would even with your strongest stroke.\nIn business terms:\n\nDrag is your Churn rate, i.e. the opposite of retention rate\nThrust is your marketing effort at any given time\nSpeed in water is your active user base\n\nWhile marketing is necessary, your active userbase (or speed in the water) is a combination of your past marketing efforts and your retention rate.\nHere’s a visual comparison of efficient vs inefficient swimming:"

    "section": "The Hidden Drivers",
    "text": "The Hidden Drivers\nHere’s something counterintuitive: in swimming, your most crucial muscles aren’t the ones you see moving. Your arms and legs create the splash, but it’s your core and hips that truly drive performance. They work silently beneath the surface, maintaining your streamlined form and minimizing drag keeping your body long and horizontal in the water.\nThe same principle applies in business. It’s easy to fixate on the visible elements - your marketing campaigns, landing pages, and ads. These are your business’s arms and legs, visibly pushing through the market. But your customer support, product reliability, and user experience? They’re your core and hips - less flashy, but absolutely critical.\nJust as a swimmer with weak core muscles will struggle regardless of arm strength, a business with poor user experience will flounder despite a massive marketing budget."

    "title": "On SaaS and Swimming: Hidden Factors of Success",
    "section": "The Paradox of Effort",
    "text": "The Paradox of Effort\nEven in swimming, there are situations where you need to decide between increasing thrust and reducing drag. A prime example is the use of legs. While leg movement contributes about 15% to overall thrust, it dramatically increases drag and often worsens your form. Counterintuitively, the advice for swimming well, especially when starting out, is to use your legs less – sometimes barely moving them at all.\nThis paradox has a direct parallel in business. Many companies engage in practices that seem to increase “thrust” but actually create more “drag”:\n\nAggressive upselling and cross-selling\nIntrusive advertising\nUser interface “dark patterns” that trick users into spending more\n\nYes, these tactics might bring in additional revenue (power) in the short term. But in the long run, they increase your drag by driving users away from your product. It’s a classic case of short-term gain leading to long-term pain. For a deeper dive into this concept and how to approach it, I recommend reading the insightful article on user disengagement by Zerodha."

    "text": "Reducing Business Drag\nIn business, reducing drag means focusing on retention. I’ve found this means:\n\nUnderstand why people leave. Talk to unhappy customers.\nIdentify unmet needs and fix what’s broken.\nDo the unglamorous work that’s important to customers.\nTreat customers as you’d want to be treated, be respectful of their time and attention.\n\nThese actions might not feel as impactful as big marketing pushes, or as cool as working on bleeding-edge technology, but they’re crucial for long-term success. They’re the equivalent of perfecting your swimming form - less visible, more effective."

    "text": "Optimizing for Success\nAnother parallel: You can only optimize one aspect at a time. There’s a limit to what your brain can focus on. In swimming, you might want to improve your arm stroke, leg kick, hip rotation, and breathing simultaneously. In business, you’re juggling product improvements, customer support, marketing, and operations.\nTrying to fix everything at once leads to slow progress and ingrained bad habits. Instead:\n\nChoose one specific area for improvement\nPractice with perfect form and intense focus\nRepeat until the action becomes automatic\n\nThis applies to both swimming and running a company, but with a key difference. In swimming, “automatic” means the movement becomes part of your neural structure, performed subconsciously. In business, it’s about setting up the right culture, people, processes, and incentives so things run smoothly without constant oversight.\nThis approach might seem slow, but it leads to sustainable, compounding improvements. You’re not just doing things right when actively focusing - you’re making high standards your default state.\nYou’ll notice Olympic swimmers cross the pool in minimal strokes - that’s mastery in action. In business, it might look like efficient processes, strong culture, the right people, and well-set incentives."

    "text": "The Long Game\nIn swimming and in business, what looks like effort isn’t always what moves you forward.\nSometimes, the key to speed is doing less. Moving your legs less in the water. Pushing your customers less.\nFocus on reducing drag. In SaaS, that means understanding your users. Solving their problems. Respecting their time.\nIt’s not as visible as marketing. But it’s what separates great products from the rest."

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nReflecting on these parallels between swimming and business, I’m reminded of Miyamoto Musashi’s quote, which could be a fitting end to this post.\n\n“If you know the way broadly you will see it in everything.”\n\nBut I’m also reminded of Abraham Maslow.\n\n“If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.”\n\nBecause while there’s wisdom in drawing parallels, there’s also wisdom in knowing when to put down the metaphorical hammer.\nHere are three important ways where the analogy breaks down which you should keep in mind.\n\nEnvironmental Consistency: Water provides a consistent environment for swimmers. In contrast, the business landscape is constantly changing, more akin to swimming in a dynamic, unpredictable ocean. your drag (churn) could suddenly rapidly increase because of competitors, regulation, effectiveness of your channels etc.\nFeedback Loops: In swimming, improvements in technique have a relatively linear effect on performance. In business, positive feedback loops (like network effects) can lead to exponential growth, a phenomenon not typically seen in swimming.\nNature of the End Goal: In swimming, the objective is typically to minimize time over a fixed distance. This is a well-defined, closed-ended goal. In business, particularly for SaaS, the goal is often open-ended growth. There’s no fixed “finish line” - the objective is continuous expansion and improvement, potentially without limit.\n\nSo take this post with a pinch of chlorine, maybe it’ll help you cut through the drag in your business (or your breaststroke), or maybe it’ll just give you a chuckle the next time you’re at the pool.\nEither way, happy swimming - and happy entrepreneur-ing!\nPS: If you’re learning to swim, I highly recommend “Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way to Swim Better, Faster, and Easier”."

This concept can be applied to various areas of life, including:\n\nProduct adoption (from “What’s a smartphone?” to “I can’t live without it!”)\nEpidemics (yeah, we’re all experts now, aren’t we?)\nThe spread of juicy gossip in your office (admit it, we’ve all been there)\nBacteria growth (think of that forgotten sandwich in the back of your fridge)\nTechnological progress (from “The internet will never catch on” to… well, look at us now)\n\nThe S-curve starts low, then grows rapidly before leveling off. It’s like your motivation during a project: starts slow, panic-fueled middle, and then plateaus just before the deadline.\nNow, there are a couple of different questions we’re interested in:\n\nWhat’s the endgame? (N - final level): In pandemic terms, how many people will ultimately catch the sniffles? For your startup, what’s the total market size for your AI-powered nose hair trimmer?\nWhen does it get wild? (t0 - inflection point): This is the “hold my beer” moment of the curve. It’s when you go from “It’s just a flu” to “WHERE’S ALL THE TOILET PAPER?!”\nHow insane is this ride? (k - slope): A high k means your growth is so fast it’ll give you whiplash. A low k? Well, let’s just say you might want to pack a sandwich for this journey.\nAre we there yet? (time to reach N): How long until we can stop holding our breath? For a pandemic, it’s about knowing when it’s safe to emerge from your toilet paper fort. For your business, it’s knowing how long before you can trade in your ramen noodles for caviar."

    "text": "Diving Deeper: The Math on Why We’re So Bad at This\nNow, if you thought I was just making this up as I go along (which, let’s be honest, is sometimes true), hold onto your hats. There’s some serious math backing up our struggles with these slippery S-curves.\nThe research paper “The Limits to Learning a Diffusion Model” 1 by Jackie Baek and friends goes deep on this, I won’t talk about the nitty gritty details here, but here is what these math wizards discovered:\n\nSize Matters, A Lot: Remember that ‘N’ parameter in our little game above? The one that kept running away from us? Well, it turns out that estimating the total population size (N) is the real troublemaker here. It’s like trying to guess how many jelly beans are in a jar, except the jar keeps changing size when you’re not looking.\nThe Two-Thirds Rule: Here’s where it gets wild. To get a decent estimate of N, you need to observe about N^(2/3) events. In English? If you’re dealing with a population of 1 million, you need to see about 10,000 events before your guess is even in the ballpark. It’s like needing to eat two-thirds of a cake to guess its flavor. By that point, why even guess?\nEarly Bird Doesn’t Get the Worm: All those early predictions? Basically fancy guesswork. The paper shows that you can’t reliably predict the eventual number of infections (or product adoptions, for you business folks) until you’re about two-thirds of the way to peak infection rate. It’s like trying to guess the ending of a movie when you’re only 20 minutes in.\nSome Things Are Easier Than Others: Not all is lost! The paper found that other parameters, like the rate of spread, are easier to estimate. It’s like being able to guess the speed of the car, but not how far it’ll go before running out of gas.\n\n\nWhat This Means for Our Little Experiment\nRemember our interactive playground above, especially with the noise set to zero? Now you know why those light blue curves are going bananas. When you’re adjusting that ‘L’ parameter, you’re not just fighting noise – you’re up against the laws of mathematics themselves. Those diverging curves are showing us all the possible futures that fit our data so far. It’s not you, it’s not the noise, it’s not even a computer glitch. It’s the fundamental nature of these curves conspiring to keep us guessing."

    "text": "Why Should You Care? (Besides Impressing People at Parties)\nNow, you might be thinking, “Cool trick, but so what?” Well, my friend, this little experiment has some big implications:\n\nEpidemic Modeling: Remember when everyone became an armchair epidemiologist in 2020? This is why even the pros were struggling. Early predictions in disease spread are about as reliable as a weather forecast for next year. Next time you see an early prediction about how bad a disease outbreak will be, take it with a grain of salt.\nProduct Adoption: If you’re in business, dreaming of that hockey stick growth, remember this curve. Your early numbers might be lying to you. Don’t count your exponential chickens before they hatch.\nData Addiction: In a world obsessed with data, this is a humbling reminder. Sometimes, more data is just more confusion. Quality over quantity, folks.\nPolicy Making: For the folks in charge, this is a reminder that early interventions are tricky. You’re often working with less information than you think you have.\nModel Complexity: Simple models are great… until they’re not. This shows why sometimes you need to break out the big guns (and the supercomputers). It’s like the difference between a tricycle and a mountain bike – both have their place, but you wouldn’t take a tricycle off-roading.\nUncertainty is Certain: Next time you see a prediction with pinpoint accuracy, remember this curve. The only thing certain about the future is uncertainty. The question should always be How uncertain?"

But remember, even a mountain of perfect data can mislead you.\nBe flexible. The future has a nasty habit of not conforming to our expectations.\nCommunicate uncertainty. Don’t just give a number.

These slippery sigmoids keep scientists on their toes and entrepreneurs on the edge of their seats.\nSo whether you’re modeling pandemics or predicting startup growth, embrace the challenge.

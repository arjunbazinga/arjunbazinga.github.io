            "content": "Problem Description . Imagine you are at a casino, and you have N slot machines to play, each slot machine gives rewards according to a fixed probability distribution. What strategy should you play with to maximise your total reward ? . This problem is known as Multi Armed Bandit problem. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np %matplotlib inline . Arms . An arm when pulled, gives a random number from a normal distribution with fixed mean(mu) and deviation(sigma). When pulled many times the frequency of the rewards look like this: . X axis is the magnitude of reward Y axis is it&#39;s frequency. . The Arm class provides an arm with these properties. . class Arm: def __init__(self, mu=None, sigma=None): if mu is None: self.mu = np.absolute(np.random.uniform()) else: self.mu = mu if sigma is None: self.sigma=np.absolute(np.random.uniform()) else: self.sigma = sigma def pull(self): reward = np.random.normal(self.mu, self.sigma, 1) return reward def get_arms(k): # returns a list of arms arms = [] for i in range(k): arms.append(Arm()) return arms . Agents . An agent here is a player who pulls arms to play. It has a policy, which is a list of probabilities associated with each arm. . The agent class makes designing agents fast. The object is initialised with arms and whether it should play all arms once as part of the initialisation. . Features provided by this class: Attributes: . expectations[i]: gives the expected reward on playing arm[i] | times_played[i]: gives the number of times the agent has played arm[i] | N = Total number of times agent has played | reward_history : list of rewards earned by the agent | choice_history : list of choices made by the agent | . Methods: . gamble(i): Plays for i iterations while updating it&#39;s policy. | play(i): Pulls arm[i] and updates reward_history, N , times_played | select_arm(): returns index of an arm by sampling probability distribution given by the policy | . class agent: def __init__(self, arms, play_once=1): self.expectations = np.zeros(len(arms)) self.times_played = np.zeros(len(arms)) self.arms = arms self.number_of_arms = len(arms) self.N = 0 self.reward_history = [] self.choice_history = [] if play_once == 1: for i in range(self.number_of_arms): self.expectations[i] = self.play(i) def play(self, index): reward = self.arms[index].pull() self.times_played[index] += 1 self.N += 1 self.choice_history.append(index) self.reward_history.append(reward) return reward def policy(self): pass def update_expectations(self, reward, index): self.expectations[index] += (reward - self.expectations[index])/self.N def select_arm(self): options = range(self.number_of_arms) i = np.random.choice(options, p=self.policy(), replace=False) return i def gamble(self, iterations): for i in range(iterations): index = self.select_arm() reward = self.play(index) self.update_expectations(reward, index) . Example agents . To make a new agent we inherit the agent class. . Time to make some agents! . First up: epsilon-greedy . This agent plays the arm with the highest expected reward with 1 - epsilon probability, and plays a random arm with epsilon probability . So epsilon = 1 =&gt; random choices epsilon = 0 =&gt; greedy choices . class epsilon_greedy(agent): def __init__(self, arms, play_once=1, epsilon=0.1): super().__init__(arms, play_once) self.epsilon = epsilon def __str__(self): return &quot;Epsilon-Greedy Agent, epsilon= &quot;+str(self.epsilon) def policy(self): temp = np.zeros_like(self.expectations) temp[np.argmax(self.expectations)] = 1-self.epsilon ans = temp + self.epsilon/self.number_of_arms return ans . Beta-Softmax . This agent plays an arm[i] with probability proportional to: e^(expected_reward(arm[i])/beta) We normalise the whole thing by the sum over all the arms. . class softmax(agent): def __init__(self, arms, play_once=1, beta=1): super().__init__(arms, play_once) self.beta = beta def __str__(self): return &quot;Softmax agent, beta= &quot;+ str(self.beta) def policy(self): temp = np.exp(self.expectations/self.beta) ans = temp / np.sum(temp, axis=0) return ans . Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1) . UCB1 agent plays the arm with the highest metric, where metric of arm i is : metric[i] = expected_reward[i] + sqrt(2*log(N)/times_played[i]) . Note Best peformance when rewards are between 0 and 1 . class ucb(agent): def __init__(self, arms, play_once=1): super().__init__(arms, play_once) def __str__(self): return &quot;UCB1 agent&quot; def policy(self): temp = self.expectations + np.sqrt(2*np.log(self.N)/self.times_played) ans = np.zeros_like(temp) ans[np.argmax(temp)] = 1 return ans . Metrics . Metric : A scalar number, makes comparison easier. To compare the performance of our agents we can use these metrics . avg_reward[i] : this gives the average reward till i+1 iteration. | max_reward : this tells us the maximum expected reward . | euclid_distance : we can think of as learnt policy and optimal policy as vectors and compute the distance between them , smaller is better . | cosine_simmilarity : compute the cos(q) between the policies. larger is better | . def maxreward(arms): #Max rewards a= [arm.mu for arm in arms] return max(a) def avg_reward(rewards): ans = [] ans.append(rewards[0]) for i in range(1,len(rewards)): ans.append(ans[i-1]+rewards[i]) for i in range(len(ans)): ans[i]/=i+1 return ans def cosine_similarity(a,b): temp = a*b temp/=(euclid_distance(a)* euclid_distance(b)) return np.sum(temp, axis=0) def euclid_distance(a): return np.sqrt(np.sum(a*a, axis=0)) . Test . This function takes a list of agents and the number of iterations. Makes each agent play, and prints its metrics. . def test(agents, iterations): for agent in agents: agent.gamble(iterations) temp = [ arm.mu for arm in levers] optimal_policy = np.zeros_like(agent.expectations) optimal_policy[temp.index(max(temp))] = 1 avg_rewards_earned = avg_reward(agent.reward_history) print(agent) print(&quot;maximum possible reward:&quot;, maxreward(levers)) print(&quot;average reward:&quot;, avg_rewards_earned[-1]) print(&quot;cosine similarity&quot; ,cosine_similarity(agent.policy(), optimal_policy)) euclid_norm = euclid_distance(agent.policy()-optimal_policy)/len(optimal_policy) print(&quot;euclidian norm &quot;,euclid_norm) plt.plot(avg_rewards_earned) plt.ylabel(&#39;Average Reward&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Iteration&#39;) plt.show() print(&quot; n&quot;) # print(&quot;optimal policy:&quot; , optimal) # print(&quot;learnt policy:&quot; ,agent.policy()) # plt.scatter(range(len(agent.choice_history)),y=agent.choice_history) # plt.title(&quot;Choices&quot;) # plt.xlabel(&quot;time&quot;) # plt.ylabel(&quot;arm&quot;) # plt.show() # print(&quot; n&quot;) . levers = get_arms(10) agents = [ epsilon_greedy(levers, epsilon=1), epsilon_greedy(levers, epsilon=0), softmax(levers, beta=0.1), ucb(levers) ] . plt.plot([ arm.mu for arm in levers] ) plt.title(&quot;distribution of expected value of arms&quot;) .

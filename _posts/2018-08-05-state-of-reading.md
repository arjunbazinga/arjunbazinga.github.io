Audio books are seeing a resurgence, because of companies like Audible.  
Text to speech is good, and is getting [better](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio) .  
Wireless Bluetooth [earphones](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) are becoming common place, the increase in convenience and battery life allows people to have them on longer.  
Unlike content that you have to watch/read, you can work on other stuff while you listen.

Creates a whole new kind of medium.  
News, blog posts and Stories most affected.  
Most of the speech generated by machines.  
Most of the classic texts available for free on the [internet](http://libgen.is/).

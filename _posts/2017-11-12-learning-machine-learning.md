This post will talk about how I'm going about learning machine learning.  

Mostly online content.


### Podcasts

These podcasts are amazing,and what got me interested in the first place. Get a podcast app, I love podcast addict (android).
Some awesome podcasts:  
* [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com)
* [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/)
* [Data Skeptic](http://dataskeptic.com)

Some that are supposed to be good but never tried:
* Not so standard deviations
* Data science at home
* Talking machines


### Online Courses
A few awesome courses.

* [Andrew Ng Coursera](http://coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)  
    A good first course, which teaches you bottom up, from basics to advanced techniques. Matlab/Octave.

* [Fast.ai](http://fast.ai)  
    A course which aims to teach by coding, and takes a top down approach.
